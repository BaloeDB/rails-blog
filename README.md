Sure, here's a simple Ruby on Rails practice project idea: A Blogging Platform. Below is a high-level overview of the project and some code snippets to get you started.

**Project Description:**
Create a blogging platform where users can create an account, write, edit, and delete their own blog posts. Other users can view these posts and leave comments.

**Models:**
1. User
2. Post
3. Comment

**Associations:**
- A User has many Posts
- A User has many Comments
- A Post belongs to a User and has many Comments
- A Comment belongs to a User and a Post

**Controllers:**
You'll need controllers for users, sessions (for login/logout), posts, and comments. The users controller will handle user registration, the sessions controller will handle login/logout, and the posts and comments controllers will handle creating/editing/deleting posts and comments.

**Views:**
You'll need views for user registration, login, post creation/editing, and comment creation.

Remember to add validations to your models to ensure data integrity. For example, you might want to validate the presence and length of the title and body fields in your Post model.

This is a high-level overview of the project. You'll need to fill in a lot of the details yourself, but this should give you a good starting point. Good luck!
